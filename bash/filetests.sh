# This script demonstrates file testing





# Test for the existence of the /etc/resolv.conf file
# TASK 1: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a regular file
# TASK 2: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a symbolic link

# TASK 3: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a directory

# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is readable

# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is writable

# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is executable
